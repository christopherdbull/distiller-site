      %p Core to how The Distiller operates are The Startup Sprints, which is an evolving framework modelled on successful startup and software development methodologies. The Sprints are applied as a part of The Distiller's free incubator model, in which peer governance and collaboration are the tenets of business development.
      %p Startups at The Distiller get access to the Labs, which are collaborative spaces in Dunedin and Auckland. Sprints are held every two weeks which keeps everyone accountable for each otherâ€™s success.
