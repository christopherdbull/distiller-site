6B Marketing exists for the sole purpose of helping local businesses dominate their online marketing. After spending years slogging away in offline sales, founder William Horton thought that there must be an easier and more effective way to get product to customers. 6B is the result of 6 months in a Basement spent fine tuning and testing different marketing techniques. The result: Marketing that gets local businesses the best return on their investment and helps them dominate the competition.

6B currently provides online marketing consulting and services to both the New Zealand and international markets, it is based out of Auckland and is owned and operated by William Horton. The company got its start in January 2013.
