We were founded in 2008 by Jason Leong, James Wigglesworth and Francois Bondiguel. Our product began with the idea that a calendar and event-based approach would be a powerful paradigm for communicating and managing financial information. Today, we offer a comprehensive experience for PFM users who seek greater control over their money.
