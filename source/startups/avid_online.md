Avid Online provides software aimed at improving the marketing potential of online stores. In the pipeline is also a number of Software as a Service products aimed at niche markets including boutique online stores and software development consultants.

The vision for the company arose from the realisation that while the ecommerce space is continuing to grow, and 'conversion optimisation' is booming, the online marketing playbook is not yet as large as that for the offline world. Just as the retail industry has changed from the days of the corner store, so too will commerce.Merchandising, Customer Service, Distribution and the Shopping Experience itself can be elevated from the status quo to a point of difference online, even for smaller retailers. 

To begin to achieve this, Avid is working towards a a portfolio of software extension for the currently most popular Ecommerce platform, Magento Ecommerce., extending through to Software as a Service offerings and perhaps even new platforms entirely. The flagship extension is aimed at providing the means to target offers and messages to consumers based on the campaign that brought them to the store (and hence their stated intention). 

The next major challenges include bringing merchandising and search opportunities to small online retailers, and helping to improve the cost effectiveness of the Magento platform for small businesses.
