five15design is the design consulting and photography freelance side of Paul Le Comte's many design passions. Believing the user experience to be the most important aspect of online engagement, UX & UI design is at the forefront of five15design. Recently however, photography has taken off with my work being used in Print and online campaigns internationally.

With a passion for Dunedin and photography, five15design will be launching a new photoblog all about the people who live, love, work, play & breathe Dunedin. 

duned.in, due to launch in March 2013 will feature the photography of Paul Le Comte and Fergus Campbell, focusing on the good people of wider Dunedin, from Middlemarch to St Clair. We'll be photographing people at their place of work, home, on the sports field or at play, with an interview on how or why they are in Dunedin and what the place means to them.
