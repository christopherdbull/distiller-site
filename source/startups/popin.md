Popin is a private social network for sharing insider information about places with your friends.

Everything is private so the information you get is always from sources that you know.  This allows you to have a better idea about whether a place is actually good or not than public services with data from people who you've never met.

We've been working on this for a couple of years now, there are 4 of us, Chris (developer), Stevie (developer), Felix (designer and front-end developer) and James (business type).
