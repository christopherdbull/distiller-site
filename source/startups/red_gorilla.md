Cool. Creative. Innovative. Passionate. Experienced. Just a few of the many adjectives that are used to describe the Red Gorilla team.

What we do

From the first meeting, we work with our clients to help them achieve business growth with a smart digital approach. We specialise in creating content, building strategies, and implementing success.

How we started

Trio Jonathan Wrait, Raycher Shyur and Cecilia Wong established Red Gorilla Ltd after working with each other on their first start-up company in university, Redit Proofreading Ltd. Having always been passionate about social and digital communications, Red Gorilla Ltd was born. With an extensive background in marketing, psychology, accounting and commercial law, it has brought us closer to clients with a thorough understanding of their business.
