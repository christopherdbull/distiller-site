Joukou is an open source platform for businesses and projects. We want your idea built on an understandable and sustainable platform, easy to use.

We were founded in 2010 by Isaac Johnston, Ben Brabant and Sebastian Berlein. Our product began with the idea that businesses should have the opportunity to build their processes in a simple way, repurposing Processes and Data flows, in a scalable and understandable fashion. In January 2015, we launch our open source platform, free to use and based upon other open source components.
